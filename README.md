# Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing

This repository is about **estimating hidden states of a system over time when measurements are noisy and uncertain**.

It studies how different Bayesian filtering and smoothing methods track system behavior, and what happens when their assumptions break in practice.

**Topics (in progress):**
- Kalman Filter (KF)
- Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
- Particle Filter (PF)
- RTS and fixed-lag smoothing
- Practical diagnostics and failure cases

🚧 This repository is under active development. Code, experiments, and explanations will be added step by step.

## About Me

I am interested in **probabilistic methods for robots**, with an emphasis on **state estimation, control, and uncertainty quantification**.
